<pre>- two OCP clusters: nonprod (dev, test, etc) and prod (prod, stage)
- allow nonprod cluster to continue pulling image updates automatically to registry
- have separate registries between nonprod and prod
- new builds only happen in nonprod, never in prod
- existing dev pipeline must be aware of possible update to deployed container by alternative parallel pipeline route and keep base image in sync

- new security pipeline, parallel to existing dev pipeline:
-- poll for updates to images in nonprod cluster
--- polling will check similar to what happens when the nonprod cluster syncs from RH Registry
--- can we capture a log of the updates from RH registry and just act on them? - prob not a good idea
--- or perform a diff between nonprod and prod registries?
--- "I am app A, need access to container X, Y, Z latest builds"
--- Define: latest build
-- run any application specific tests (?), i.e. smoke tests
--- this requires the process to be built independently for EVERY application, and effectively must be a CI pipeline
-- queue for manual verification by users before pushing to production cluster
--- this would allow scheduling of the final push to the prod cluster (scheduling could be automatic based on programmed times/behaviors, send an email to notify admins what is happening)
--- the prod cluster would have DC set to update/rollout on ImageChange, or would have to change the tag in the DC.  If going to a stage env inside prod cluster first, may need to change tags instead of rely on ImageChange (which would kick off both stage and prod at same time).
--- users will want to know what running containers are affected
--- users schedule a time the push to prod cluster happens
--- or alternatively, users push immediately
--- users will want a status update (email?) by each image update


- new security pipeline, parallel to existing dev pipeline:
-- poll for updates to core images from RHCC (--scheduled=true)
--- Application with tag "app-v1.2.3" updates to "app-v1.2.3" (no change in tag) based on seeing a change in underlying image, kicks off build trigger, then kicks off deploy trigger
-- poll for updates to images in nonprod cluster (check existing image sha256 in dev registry "app-v1.2.3" and compares it to prod registry "app-v1.2.3-0001"
--- Define: latest build. Application with tag "app-v1.2.3-0001" updates to "app-v1.2.3-0002" based on dev environment change to sha256 and
-- run any application specific tests (?), i.e. smoke tests
--- this requires the process to be built independently for EVERY application, and effectively must be a CI pipeline
-- queue for manual verification by users before pushing to production cluster
--- this would allow manual scheduling of the final push to the prod cluster
--- change the dc to match with latest build tag, or keep same build tag and just do a rollout?
--- users will want to know what running containers are affected
--- users schedule a time the push to prod cluster happens
--- or alternatively, users push immediately
--- users will want a status update (email?) by each image update
