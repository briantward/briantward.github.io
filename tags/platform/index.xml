        <description>Security Pipelines in OpenShift Container Platform These are random notes for work in progress coded at https://github.com/briantward/container-pipelines/tree/parallel-spring-boot
 - two OCP clusters: nonprod (dev, test, etc) and prod (prod, stage) - allow nonprod cluster to continue pulling image updates automatically to registry - have separate registries between nonprod and prod - new builds only happen in nonprod, never in prod - existing dev pipeline must be aware of possible update to deployed container by alternative parallel pipeline route and keep base image in sync - new security pipeline, parallel to existing dev pipeline: -- poll for updates to images in nonprod cluster --- polling will check similar to what happens when the nonprod cluster syncs from RH Registry --- can we capture a log of the updates from RH registry and just act on them?</description>
