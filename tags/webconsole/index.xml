        <description>OpenShift Web Console Extensions Testing Environment: OpenShift 3.11
Applicable Environment: OpenShift 3.9+
 As of OpenShift 3.9, the web console requires URL references rather than static content directories.[1]
 In OpenShift 3.7 and lower, you could mount static files from your masters through the master-config.yaml file.[2] Since this no longer applies, we have to provide our own webserver with the content, to be referenced by the web console pod remotely. I checked for ways to mount static files to the web console pod; however, in the new design there is no static directory location within the pod itself from which it could reference such files.</description>
