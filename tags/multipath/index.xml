        <description>RHVH Ovirt Red Hat documentation is pretty thorough on the subject of multipath, which is a lovely failover mechanism for connections between remote volumes provided by SANs and the host.[1][2]
 There is even this KCS that discusses the matter a little more: Internal disk device is being detected as multipath device
 In setting up my bare metal servers for RHVH, after adding all my disks to the system as basically single RAID 0 disks, I found that the base image for RHVH had particular settings for creating a single path multipath entry for these.</description>
