        <description>OpenShift Application Core Dumps When logs fail to provide us the information we need to diagnose an application problem, we may find it useful to take core dumps of memory, showing us the processes as they are currently running in the system. This is not something we want to do on a regular basis in production. Ideally such problems are discovered during application performance and load testing in lower environments. In reality we frequently find something unique about the real-world application load that our test scenarios could never uncover.</description>
