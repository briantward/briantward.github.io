        <description>Image Video Metadata Tips Recently I found a bunch of photos that had the wrong capture date, a result of the device not having the correct date when the photos were captured. This is pretty annoying, but can be fixed with a nice perl utility called exiftool. Apple and a bunch of other photo tools these days use these dates for sorting your photos. So if something isn&amp;#8217;t right, it can be pretty confusing/noticeable.</description>

        <description>Image Video Metadata Tips My wife and I wanted to combine photos and videos from my Samsung S7 and her iPhone 6. Apple has a nice app that compiles photos and videos with background music, but doesn&amp;#8217;t give you a lot of customization options. We couldn&amp;#8217;t sort except by date. Since we wanted one particular photo at the end, we figured we would just hack the create date to trick it.</description>
