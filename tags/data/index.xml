        <description>Restore files from rm I wanted to type:
 $ rm *.retry   Instead I accidentally typed:
 $ rm * .retry   That wiped out the four or five files I had been working on the last two days. I was lucky it wasn&amp;#8217;t more. I was lucky I didn&amp;#8217;t care about the binary data I had in the folder. It took a little time and work, but in the end, I was able to find all the documents.</description>
