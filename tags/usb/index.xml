        <description>I&amp;#8217;m on a Lenovo T460s running fedora 27. One day, I ran into an issue with my video setup. It occurred to me that I had not updated my bios in a while, and since the whole Meltdown/Spectre thing came up, I should probably check on this. Yes, sure enough, I was on patch 1.20, the latest was 1.34, and the fix for Meltdown/Spectre was in 1.31. Good thing no one cares about my machine but me.</description>
