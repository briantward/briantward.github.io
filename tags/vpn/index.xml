        <description>Split DNS Resolution with VPN DNS and Local DNS Edit 2019-05-16: This work is superceded by this wonderful feature in NetworkManager now:
   https://fedoramagazine.org/using-the-networkmanagers-dnsmasq-plugin/
   Note: does not work as expected. Trouble with connecting to different wireless networks, as each one needs manual tweak. Need a better solution.
 I recently installed a local identity management server with Red Hat Identity Management. This is essentially a free-ipa server that hosts some certificate management, DNS, and LDAP to track both my machines and my users on my local network.</description>
