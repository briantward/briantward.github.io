        <description>Note: Out of Date and incorrect analysis.
 I&amp;#8217;m running fedora 27 on my Lenovo T460s and have been for a while. I have a docking station with two 24&#34; monitors at work and another docking station with two 27&#34; monitors at home. I switch between them frequently. Back in fedora 21 and 22 I had tons of problems. Sometimes monitors didn&amp;#8217;t come on, sometimes one monitor came on, and sometimes things worked fine.</description>
