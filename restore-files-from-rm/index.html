It took a little time and work, but in the end, I was able to find all the documents.  I would only add to the original stack exchange post that I think it cautious to write your output to a different block device.  In my case <code>/tmp</code> has a different volume than my home directory.  You want to minimize all writes to the volume where your data was stored.  If at all possible, unmount the drive.  I&#8217;m not sure about how much gets written when you shutdown a system, but you could also either pull the power, at the risk of corrupting other data, or do a clean shutdown, at the risk of overwriting blocks you need.  From there, mounting the block device readonly from a different system would be the safest, though has the drawback of requiring you to remove the device from one machine and connect it to another.</p>
