        <description>Expand a Qemu Disk I exhausted the disk space on my Windows VM and found I needed more room. This is one of those lovely tasks that actually has simple and good documentation and works easily enough.
 I followed these instructions using qemu-resize:
 https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-using_qemu_img-re_sizing_the_disk_image
 But you might find this just as helpful:

        <description>Build A Router on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 This provided a nice resource for reference.[1] I will elaborate a litte more here. I wanted to set up a custom router to the internet, to provide advanced firewall and logging features. Note that this example does not provide DHCP services. In my case, I have a secondary off-the-shelf (OTS) router doing that. Since the OTS router did not offer advanced firewall, NAT, port-forwarding, and such features, I decided to build my own.</description>
