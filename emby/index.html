<div class="paragraph">
<p>Started with PMS, Plex Media Server. What a terrible acronym. Let’s just call it Plex. I got this working from its official Docker image with a little work, to run using rootless containers with Podman instead of Docker. But I found out this requires a login to authorize and synchronize machine access.  Bleh.  How awful.  The whole point of running my own software is that I control it without any phone home to another third party organization.  Plex is dumped. I know how to manage my networking, and I don’t care about UPNP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I checked out Emby, as others recommended after finding the auth requirement for Plex.  It has a Tizen app for Samsung TVs so looks promising. But on first load of my test ISO, it failed to play properly.  No ISO support.  Ok, so that is asking a lot I suppose, but it’s a lot of work for me to convert hundreds of DVD ISOs to mp4 or mkv.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then I checked out Kodi, which appears to be the first for many to select.  I didn’t care much for the fact that they did not build their own container images.  Linuxserver.io however builds one, and it worked fairly well I think.  But I never figured out how to get the headless kodi instance to scan any particular folders for media.  Maybe it was the web browser interface, Chorus.  After 20 minutes of searching the web for answers and clicking around in the interface, I decided this idea was dead.  Kodi apparently supports ISO, which is a huge plus for me, but it does not have a Tizen native app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So back to Emby.  It looks as though I’ll be building a process to convert all my ISO images to mp4.</p>

...
       --systemd=true|false

       Run container in systemd mode. The default is true.

       If the command you running inside of the container is systemd or init, podman will setup tmpfs mount points in the following directories:

       /run, /run/lock, /tmp, /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd, /var/lib/journal

       It will also set the default stop signal to SIGRTMIN+3.

       This allow systemd to run in a confined container without any modifications.

       Note: On SELinux systems, systemd attempts to write to the cgroup file system.  Containers writing to the cgroup file system are denied by default.  The container_manage_cgroup boolean must be enabled for this to be allowed
       on an SELinux separated system.
